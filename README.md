# Prompt Engineering

This project showcases a comprehensive collection of prompt-engineering work, including hands-on experiments with GPT-4, detailed prompt-design techniques, and structured templates supported by real success and failure cases. It also includes curated prompts across ten different domains, practical demonstrations of API-based prompt execution, examples of function-calling workflows, and system-prompt strategies for building more robust and controllable LLM applications. Overall, the repository serves as a practical guide for understanding, designing, testing, and optimizing prompts for advanced large-language-model systems.
